# Gladiator Wins Tracker

Adds a button to the **rated PVP tab** that tracks the gladiator achievement for the current PVP season. Allowing players to see how many wins they need without having to search wowhead for the script.

### Explanation:

The default Blizzard achievement UI does not provide a way to track this achievement (unless you have already obtained it on another character).

### Commands:

- **/gwt** -- open the options panel
